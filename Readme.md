I wanted to explore new tastes in interpreted languages and that's how I decided to learn nodeJS. This repository contains my steps ðŸ‘ž and the learning path I followed in order to master ðŸ§  the C programming language.

## Description
Javascript code files that I wrote while I was learning nodejs, I started as a beginner from the most basic and I hope to master nodejs later

## Motivations

- The ability to create server applications using javascript.
- Create mobile applications using technologies that run on nodeJS.
- Use web technologies to create desktop applications using Electorn.JS.
- The ability to use NodeJS in robotics projects as well as use it with raspberry.
- And many more...
